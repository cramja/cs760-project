Welcome to our cs760 - Machine Learning project page. 

Our group focused our research efforts on investigating recently developed algorithms to improve SGD. These methods are called "Variance reduction methods". The bulk of our research was here.

Hopefully you can learn about what these methods are, their update formulas, and use our visualization tool to intuitively understand how the algorithms compare!

One of the problems we ran into when testing our experimental code, was that finding the optimal hyper parameters was difficult- we originally searched by hand but later switched to a grid search. We have a small write up on new grid search methods which we tried when doing our main experiments with Variance reduction methods.
